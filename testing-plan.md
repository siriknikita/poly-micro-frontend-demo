# Testing Plan for Poly Micro Manager Frontend

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/unit/`
- **Focus Areas**:
  - UI Components (buttons, inputs, modals)
  - Hooks
  - Utility functions
  - Context providers
  - State management

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between components
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/integration/`
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Component interactions
  - Context integration
  - Page components
  - Navigation flows
  - Data fetching and state updates

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Location**: `e2e/`
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Critical user paths
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Navigation across the application
  - Form submission and validation
  - Error handling
  - Performance

## Test Cases

### Unit Tests
1. UI Components
   - IconButton: Renders correctly with different props
   - SearchInput: Handles input changes
   - TestItemComponent: Renders in different states
   - NavigationControls: Shows proper navigation options
   - ResizeHandle: Handles resize events
   
2. Hooks
   - useResizablePanel: Properly manages resizable panels
   - useTestItems: Correctly manages test items state
   - useMicroserviceNavigation: Navigates between microservices
   
3. Utility Functions
   - Data transformations
   - Formatting functions
   - Helper methods

### Integration Tests
1. TestList Component
   - Renders test items correctly
   - Expands/collapses test items
   - Applies filters correctly
   - Handles empty states

2. AutomatedTesting Component
   - Integrates with TestList
   - Handles panel resizing
   - Manages microservice navigation
   - Shows proper notifications

3. Settings Page
   - Saves user preferences
   - Applies themes correctly
   - Updates user settings

### E2E Tests
1. Project Selection Flow
   - User can view available projects
   - User can select a project
   - Application remembers selected project

2. Microservice Management
   - User can search for microservices
   - Navigation between microservices works
   - Microservice state is preserved

3. Testing Workflow
   - User can create tests
   - Tests can be executed
   - Results are displayed correctly
   - Users can view test history

4. CI/CD Pipeline Features
   - Elements can be linked with logical flow
   - Global and local variables work as expected
   - Pipeline changes are saved correctly

5. Error Handling
   - Application handles API errors gracefully
   - User is notified of errors appropriately
   - Recovery paths work as expected

## Mock Strategy
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Create mock data for different testing scenarios
- Implement test utilities for common testing patterns

## Test Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration Tests: 70%+ coverage
- E2E Tests: Cover all critical user workflows

## Implementation Timeline
1. Set up testing infrastructure and tools
2. Implement unit tests for core components
3. Add integration tests for key pages
4. Develop E2E tests for critical workflows
5. Configure CI pipeline for automated testing
