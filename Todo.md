## Coursework Todo

1. Ability to link different elements of the CI/CD Pipeline together using logical flow elements/arrows.
2. Make use of global and local variables in the CI/CD Pipeline.
3. Add toast notifications for every relevant action in the application.
4. Add a user customization page for the application (`/settings`).
5. Add the ability to receive short guidance on how to use the application.
6. When a project is not selected, we should show placeholders in the form of text that let you know about it.
7. If there are no logs available for a project/microservice, we should display a message about it instead of showing a table.
8. Add the ability to search for available microservices using the lense icon next to the list of available microservices, and then entering the desired microservice name.
9. If we don't have a selected microservice saved in `localStorage` for a given section, we should default to the first microservice in the list.
10. When I click on the application logo (at the top, before the list of available projects), a new window should open where the application landing page is shown.
