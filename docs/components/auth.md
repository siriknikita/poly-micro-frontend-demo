# Authentication Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Authentication feature provides user authentication and registration functionality for the Poly Micro Manager application. It handles user login, registration, and session management to secure access to the application's features.

## Key Components

### LoginForm.tsx

Provides a form interface for users to log in to the application.

**Key Features:**
- Email and password input fields
- Form validation
- Error handling and display
- "Remember me" functionality
- Login submission

### RegisterForm.tsx

Provides a form interface for new users to register for the application.

**Key Features:**
- User information input fields (name, email, password)
- Password confirmation and validation
- Form validation
- Error handling and display
- Registration submission

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Access**: When a user accesses the application, they are directed to the login page if not authenticated
2. **Login/Register**: User enters credentials or registers a new account
3. **Validation**: The application validates the credentials against the backend
4. **Session Management**: Upon successful authentication, a session is created
5. **Access Control**: The authenticated user is granted access to protected features

## Integration with Other Features

- **All Protected Features**: Authentication is required to access testing, monitoring, and pipelining features
- **User-specific Data**: User authentication determines what projects and microservices are accessible

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Form inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
- Authentication tokens are securely stored and managed
- Session timeout and automatic logout for security

## Usage Examples

### User Login

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter email and password
3. Click "Login" button
4. Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to the dashboard

### User Registration

1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Enter required information (name, email, password)
