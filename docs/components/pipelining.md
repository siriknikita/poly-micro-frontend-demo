# Pipelining Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Pipelining feature provides CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline
management for microservices. It allows users to create, configure, and execute deployment pipelines
with a visual interface, manage pipeline variables, and monitor pipeline execution.

## Key Components

### CICDPipeline.tsx

The main container component for the pipelining feature. It integrates all pipeline components and
manages the overall state of the pipeline interface.

**Key Features:**

- Pipeline creation and management
- Pipeline execution and monitoring
- Integration with microservices
- Pipeline history and versioning

### PipelineCanvas.tsx

Provides a visual canvas for building and configuring pipelines.

**Key Features:**

- Drag-and-drop pipeline building
- Visual representation of pipeline flow
- Connection management between blocks
- Pipeline validation

### PipelineToolbox.tsx

Contains available pipeline blocks that can be added to the pipeline.

**Key Features:**

- Categorized pipeline blocks
- Block descriptions and usage information
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Custom block creation

### BlockConfigModal.tsx

Modal for configuring individual pipeline blocks.

**Key Features:**

- Block-specific configuration options
- Parameter validation
- Environment variable integration
- Dependency management

### VariablesPanel.tsx

Panel for managing pipeline variables and environment configurations.

**Key Features:**

- Variable creation and management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret management
- Variable usage tracking

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Pipeline Creation**: Users create a new pipeline using the PipelineCanvas
2. **Block Configuration**: Pipeline blocks are added and configured
3. **Variable Setup**: Environment variables and secrets are configured
4. **Validation**: Pipeline is validated for correctness
5. **Execution**: Pipeline is executed against the target microservice
6. **Monitoring**: Execution progress is monitored in real-time
7. **Results**: Execution results are displayed and logged

## Integration with Other Features

- **Testing**: Tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline execution is monitored and results are displayed in the monitoring
  dashboard
- **Authentication**: User permissions determine pipeline access and execution rights

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Pipeline

1. Navigate to the Pipelining section from the sidebar
2. Click "Create New Pipeline"
3. Drag blocks from the PipelineToolbox to the PipelineCanvas
4. Connect blocks to create the pipeline flow
5. Configure each block using the BlockConfigModal
6. Set up environment variables in the VariablesPanel
7. Save the pipeline configuration

### Executing a Pipeline

1. Select an existing pipeline
2. Review the pipeline configuration
3. Click "Execute Pipeline"
4. Monitor the execution progress
5. View execution results and logs
6. Address any issues that arise during execution

### Managing Pipeline Variables

1. Open the VariablesPanel
2. Create or modify environment variables
3. Configure environment-specific values
4. Manage secrets securely
5. Apply variables to specific pipeline blocks
