# Design Patterns and Architecture

This document outlines the key design patterns and architectural approaches used in the Poly Micro
Manager frontend application.

## 1. 🏛️ Architecture Principles: SOLID in React

The application follows SOLID principles adapted for React:

- **S — Single Responsibility Principle**:  
  Each component has **one purpose** only.  
  _Example_: The `TestList` component only renders test items, while the logic for managing test
  items is extracted into the `useTestItems` hook.

- **O — Open/Closed Principle**:  
  Components are **open for extension**, but **closed for modification**.  
  _Example_: Components accept props for customization instead of hardcoding behavior.

- **L — Liskov Substitution Principle**:  
  Every derived component is replaceable without breaking parent components.  
  _Example_: Specialized button components like `IconButton` can be used anywhere a regular button
  is used.

- **I — Interface Segregation Principle**:  
  Props are broken into smaller focused interfaces.  
  _Example_: Components like `TestList` have specific prop interfaces that only include what they
  need.

- **D — Dependency Inversion Principle**:  
  Components depend on **abstractions**, not on concretions.  
  _Example_: Custom hooks like `useServiceSelection` abstract away the implementation details of
  service selection.

## 2. 🌱 Component Structure and Organization

### Feature-Based Organization

The project is organized by feature rather than by type:

```
components/
├── auth/             # Authentication feature
├── monitoring/       # Monitoring feature
├── pipelining/       # CI/CD pipeline feature
├── testing/          # Automated testing feature
└── shared/           # Shared components
```

Each feature folder contains:

- Components specific to that feature
- Feature-specific hooks
- Constants and types
- Index files for easier importing

### Component Structure

Components follow a consistent structure:

- Props interface defined at the top
- Memoization with React.memo for performance
- Custom hooks for logic extraction
- JSX kept as clean as possible with minimal logic

## 3. ⚙️ Custom Hooks Pattern

Custom hooks are extensively used to separate logic from UI components:

### Types of Hooks

- **Feature-specific hooks**: Located in feature directories (e.g., `useTestItems` in testing)
- **Shared hooks**: Located in the root hooks directory (e.g., `useForm`)
- **Context hooks**: For accessing context (e.g., `useToast`, `useProject`)

### Hook Patterns

- **State Management**: Hooks like `useForm` manage complex state logic
- **Side Effects**: Hooks handle side effects like API calls and localStorage
- **UI Behavior**: Hooks like `useResizablePanel` manage UI interactions
- **Feature Logic**: Hooks like `useServiceSelection` encapsulate feature-specific logic

## 4. 📚 Testing Patterns

The project uses a comprehensive testing approach:

### Test Organization

Tests mirror the source code structure:

```
__tests__/
├── unit/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── components/
│   └── hooks/
└── integration/
```

### Testing Patterns

- **Hook Testing**: Testing hooks with `renderHook` from React Testing Library
- **Component Testing**: Testing components with React Testing Library
- **Mock Patterns**: Using Jest mocks for services and browser APIs
- **Test Isolation**: Each test focuses on a specific functionality

## 5. 🛡️ Other Architectural Patterns

### Context API for Global State

- Project context for project-wide data
- Toast context for notifications
- Authentication context for user state

### Compound Components

Components that work together to provide a cohesive UI experience:

- Parent components manage state and provide context
- Child components consume context and render UI elements

### Render Props and Higher-Order Components

Used selectively for cross-cutting concerns:

- Error boundaries
- Authentication guards
- Feature flags

### TypeScript Type Patterns

- Strict typing with interfaces and types
- Prop interfaces for components
- Generic types for reusable components and hooks
- Utility types for transforming existing types

## 6. 🧩 UI Component Patterns

### Atomic Design Principles

Components are organized following atomic design principles:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
- **Molecules**: Simple component combinations (form fields with labels)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (forms, dashboards)
- **Templates**: Page layouts
- **Pages**: Complete pages with data

### Composition Over Inheritance

Components are composed together rather than extended:

- Higher-order components are used sparingly
- Component composition is preferred for building complex UIs
- Props are used to customize behavior

### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

Both patterns are used where appropriate:

- Controlled components for forms and inputs
- Uncontrolled components for simple UI elements

## 7. 🔄 State Management Patterns

### Local Component State

- useState for simple component state
- useReducer for complex state logic

### Context API for Shared State

- Context providers for sharing state between components
- Custom hooks for accessing context

### Custom Hook State

- Custom hooks encapsulate and manage related state
- Hooks compose together to build complex behavior

## Conclusion

These patterns and architectural approaches help maintain a clean, maintainable, and scalable
codebase. By following these patterns consistently, the application remains flexible and adaptable
to changing requirements while maintaining high code quality.
