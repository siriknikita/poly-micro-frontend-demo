# Poly Micro Manager - Frontend Documentation

This documentation provides detailed information about the features, components, and architecture of
the Poly Micro Manager frontend application.

## Overview

The Poly Micro Manager is a comprehensive tool designed to manage microservices architecture. It
provides features for:

- **Authentication**: User login and registration
- **Testing**: Automated testing of microservices
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of microservice health and performance
- **Pipelining**: CI/CD pipeline management for microservices
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components used across the application

## Project Structure

The application follows a modular architecture with components organized by feature and
functionality:
